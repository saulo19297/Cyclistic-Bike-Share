# Cyclistic-Bike-Share
documentation of the process done with Cyclistic Bike_share data analysis.

## Project
a bike-share company's director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the goal is to analyze
de data provided to find out what is the different between casual riders and members.

## Data Cleaning
- check all files have the same columns
- remove empty rows
- add new column ride_length that tells the duration of trips in minutes

  ## Data Analysis
  -order data by month then by day
  -average of ride length by month and day

  ## Visualization
  - amount of total casual riders vs members
  - average trip length casual riders vs members per month
  - average trip length casual riders vs members per day

## Recomendations
- Make membership price cheaper to casual riders that use a bike for 20 or more minutes
- Increase prices on weekends for single rides
